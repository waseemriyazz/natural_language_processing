And also better because a neurologist can make a differential diagnosis between migraine tensiontype headache cluster benign intracranial hypertension chronic paroxysmal hemicrania and other headache syndromes that all appear normal on a scan.  A neurologist can also recommend a course of treatment that is appropriate to the diagnosis.  DN Also since many people are convinced they have brain tumors or other DN serious pathology it may be cheaper to just get a CT scan then have DN them come into the ER every few weeks. DN And easier than taking the time to reassure the patient right DN Personally I dont think this can ever be justified.  Sigh.  It may never be justifiable but I sometimes do it.  Even after I try to show thoroughness with a detailed history neurologic examination and discussion with the patient about my diagnosis salted with lots of reassurance patients still ask why cant you order a scan so we can be absolutely sure  Aunt Millie often gets into the conversation as in they ignored Aunt Millies headaches for years and then she died of a brain tumor aneurysm or whatever.  If you can get away without ever ordering imaging for a patient with an obviously benign headache syndrome Id like to hear what your magic is.  Every once in a while I am able to bypass imaging by getting an EEG. Mind you I dont think EEG is terribly sensitive for brain tumor but the patient feels like something is being done as if the hours I spent talking with and examining the patient were nothing the EEG has no ionizing radiation its much cheaper than CT or MRI and the EEG brings in some money to my department.\n"]}],"source":["print(concatenated_df['text'][11309])"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":40,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-17T10:00:14.453355Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-17T10:00:14.452968Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-17T10:00:14.459580Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-17T10:00:14.458590Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-17T10:00:14.453324Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["def
